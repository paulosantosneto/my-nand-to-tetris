The focus of this repository is to store my solutions to the problems provided by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in the course 'Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)'. 

The course is taught by Doctors Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. The files available in the repository are a union of the teachers' codes and my solutions.
